## How?
### Sever
This is the websocket server that will run on your computer and control the RC car. It is built with Electron JS.
- Install node js on your computer.
- Go into /Server and run `npm install`.
- Start the server with `npm start`.
- Go to your modem control panel and forward port 8000.

### RC car
- Change the values in **config_example.h** to match your setup, and rename the file to **config.h**.
- With the Arduino IDE, compile and upload **TruckScript/TruckScript.ino**
- From your computer, create a room in https://vdo.ninja/ and join the room from your old phone, creating a live video feed.
- Securely fasten your phone to the RC car
